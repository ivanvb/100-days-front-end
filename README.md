# 100 Days of Front End

I will build a mini website in plain HTML, CSS and Javascript for 100 days. Each day's website will be different.

You can check my progress [here](https://ivb98.github.io/100-days-front-end/)

## Why?

At the time of starting this challenge I've been working with web technologies for over a year. During this year I've learnt quite a lot, however I've been feeling like I am relying too much on libraries like Bootstrap to achieve some stylings that I could easily do myself.

Also, as these libraries have default stylings if at some point I need to add some customization into my projects it can become a painpoint due to my lack of understanding of some CSS concepts.

## Rules

For the duration of this project I will build a mini project using only HTML, CSS and Javascript. This means that I will not be using any type of CSS nor Javascript library.

The only exception to this happens in the build process, where I will use my own build scripts to dynamically add each day's project to the [Homescreen](https://ivb98.github.io/100-days-front-end/), for this I may also install some external libraries if needed as this has nothing to do with front end development.

Also, I may use some tools such as [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) or [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) to add compatibility with older browsers.

**Note:** To reset browser default I've included a generic `reset.css` file in some of the projects when I find it necessary.
